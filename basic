Typescript is basic for angular 

Componenets  (data  + html + css)
  Components are the main building blocks for Angular applications.
  Each component consists of: An HTML template that declares what renders on the page. 
  A TypeScript class that defines behavior. A CSS selector that defines how the component is used in a templat

  @Component({
   selector :'app-employee',
   templateUrl: './employee.component.html',
